# The Greenlight Project

Following the famous book [Letâ€™s Go Further](https://lets-go-further.alexedwards.net/)

### This repository uses some different libraries compared to the book:
- [`pgx`](https://github.com/jackc/pgx) instead of [`pq`](https://github.com/lib/pq) for PostgreSQL: `pg` is unmaintained and `pgx` is a more modern and faster alternative.
- `net/http` instead of `httprouter` for the HTTP router: `net/http` is a standard library and is enough with the enhancements of Go 1.22
